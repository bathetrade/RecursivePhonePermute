This is my quick attempt at a Twitter interview question that involves recursively printing all possible character permutations, given a numeric string of keys on a phone.

Example: A user enters "25", corresponding to the letters "abc" and "jkl" on a phone, respectively. Output:

aj
ak
al
bj
bk
bl
cj
ck
cl
